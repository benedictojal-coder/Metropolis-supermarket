# Metropolis Supermarket
A web-based application where users can buy and sell products online, featuring a feature-rich UI with sections for order history, categorized products, search bar, profile, login/logout, and secure payments. Inspired by platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, it handles transactions and data records efficiently with the MERN stack.

This project is part of my journey in **Full Stack Development with React & Node JS**, covering everything a developer needs to know to build production-ready applications.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (Dynamic & Responsive UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express (API requests & Transaction processing)
- **Database:** MongoDB (Flexible, document-based storage)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Payments:** Stripe API (Upcoming)
- **DevOps:** Docker & Vercel Deployment

## Learning Outcomes
- Implementing Global State Management with Redux Toolkit.
- Building RESTful APIs and connecting them to a NoSQL database.
- Handling secure user authentication and authorization.
- Deploying a full-stack application to a cloud environment.
